Welcome legendary Hero! We are in dire need of your help!
A human-eating, village destroying, fire-breathing Dragon has appeared and is terrifying my Kingdom.
I have waited for you, own fearless hero, to arrive and help us defeat this evil dragon.
And with that, I hope you can go on your way to slay the vile beast.  Oh, you'll find them to the West of here.  Best of luck!

You will find the monstrosity to the West of here!  It is a ferocious and powerful beast, but I believe you will succeed!

It is an extremely tough beast to tackle and many brave challengers have fallen at it's feet.
But I believe that you are the destined hero who will defeat this fearosome evil once and for all!  Never give up and go forth to tackle it once more!

Are you awake my hero?  It seems the monsters obtained the upper hand over you in your last encounter, but fortunately we were able to drag you to safety and bring you back to our base.
If you are fully recovered, bear arms once again and head West to tackle it one more time!

I knew you could do it!  Our kingdom is now safe from the dragon's tyrannical reign!  Thank you for completing this arduous task!
And thank you for playing this tech demo.  I hope you enjoyed your time and I look forward to presenting more games for you to enjoy in the future!
